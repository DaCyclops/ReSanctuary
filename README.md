*"Improve your Island Sanctuary experience."*

ReSanctuary is a [Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) plugin to improve Island Sanctuary in FINAL FANTASY XIV, with the following features:

- Mark items to gather on the proper map
- Gathering & crafting todo-list, showing you what mats you require
- Better inventory view
- Widget for quick access to information

ReSanctuary's icon is from the Mutant Standard project.

## A personal note

I made ReSanctuary years ago in an effort to try and do something cool that nobody else has done before. As a result, the code quality is very very bad. I've tried my best to clean it up, but it's still jank (e.g. still reading raw Excel data because this was before they were added to SaintCoinach).
